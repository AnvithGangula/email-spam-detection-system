# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection Model

Welcome to the Email Spam Detection Model project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate spam detection.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust email spam detection system using machine learning. The system processes email content and classifies it into spam or non-spam categories.
